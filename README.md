## Description

_Project Instructions:_

This will be a two-week project. Spend today building a tap room in React where a bar or kombucha store can track their kegs. This could also be a soda fountain or another kind of tracker - as long as you're able to track the remaining amount and meet the objectives, you can be creative with this prompt.

Before getting started, plan out your application and draw a component tree or component diagram that shows the structure of your components. This is a requirement for the project and should be included in your README. You may draw the structure on a piece of paper and take a picture of it or use an application like https://www.draw.io/.

Here are some user stories to get you started. The application should have the following functionality:

As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store).
As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.
Further Exploration
If you have time remaining after you complete the required objectives, work on the following user stories:

As a user, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
As a user, I want to be able to delete a keg.
As a user, I want a keg to update to say "Out of Stock" once it's empty.
As a user, I want kegs with less than 10 pints to include a message that says "Almost Empty" so I can try a pint before it's gone!
As a user, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. This could be based on their price, the style of beer or kombucha, or the amount of pints left.
As a user, I want this application to be nicely styled. (Use stylesheets and CSS objects!)
